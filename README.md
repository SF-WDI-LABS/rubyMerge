# Merge Ruby Implementation

## Specs

`#merge` merges two sorted arrays

## Steps

* Recall how `merge` works
* **Pseudocode before!**
* Run `rspec` in this directory to see your failing tests
* Implement your code in Ruby in `merge.rb`
* Pass the tests in the `/spec` directory
* Refactor your code
* *Bonus:* add more tests to increase coverage of edge cases & pass them as well
